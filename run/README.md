### extract_videos_from_files.py
Create files for videos containing paths to images and their true labels extracted from a file with all training/testing examples. The dataset is split according to its name. Thus, each dataset has its own characteristics. Implemented Dogentric, KSCGR and UCF-11 so far. 

### resize_images.py
Receives a file containing paths to images and the size of the output images. Convert all images of the file into the specific size. It is important to tell the script the name of the dataset since it has to create the path to the folders up to the image.

### img_mean.py
From a file containing paths and true labels, the script generates the mean of all images of the file. The mean can be generated by pixel (passing ``-p`` as argument) or by channel (choosing the order of the channels in the argument ``-c``).
